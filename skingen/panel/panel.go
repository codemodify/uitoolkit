// Package panel is where the two panel faces of the compact player are, as
// numbers: every well, key, slider and label, in the design pixels the art is
// drawn in.
//
// Minim wears three skins. The first, "minim", dresses the ordinary widgets
// of an ordinary layout. The other two, "minim-classic" and "minim-silver",
// are panels: the window is a picture with holes in it where the controls
// are, which is how a player of this shape was always built.
//
// It sits under the generator (github.com/codemodify/uitoolkit/skingen)
// because that is whose input it is: these numbers are the art plan of two
// shipped skins, and they are published with the rest of the plans so that
// an outside author can fork a panel face instead of measuring one. The
// generator draws each face's backgrounds with its wells, grooves and
// printed labels at these rects, and writes the same rects into each skin's
// manifest as a fixed layout ([Face.Layouts]): named slots the player binds
// its controls to (docs/skins.md, "Fixed layouts").
//
// The player takes nothing from here but the layouts' names and the three
// window sizes — it asks the skin it is wearing where each slot is — so the
// art and the layout cannot disagree about where a key is, and a skin
// someone else draws for the player places its keys wherever its own art
// has them.
//
// Every rect is {x, y, w, h} in the window's *content* box: the window less
// the skin's border and caption, which are stated here too because the art
// needs them and they are the skin's to say.
//
// The positions of the classic face follow the published layout of the
// 275×116 skin format of the era (a 14-pixel title bar, a clock at 48,26 in
// 9×13 digits, a 248-pixel seek bar at 16,72 and so on), which is widely
// documented and is a fact about a file format rather than anybody's art.
// The silver face's are measured off the proportions of the later rounded
// look. Nothing here is a picture.
