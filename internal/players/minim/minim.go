// Package minim is the compact player: a strip 275 by 116 design pixels
// with an equaliser and a playlist that stick to its edges and travel with
// it.
//
// It is a **visual demo**. Nothing is decoded and nothing is played; the
// clock counts, the seek bar scrubs the clock, the analyser is a function of
// where the clock is, and the equaliser's ten faders move and filter
// nothing. The window says so and so does its About box.
//
// What it is a demo *of* is three things the toolkit gained and no toolkit
// of the era had all of:
//
//   - A skin is a pack. Minim wears the "minim" skin, which is a pixel sheet
//     over win95; run it with UITK_THEME=breeze-night and it is the same app
//     in an ordinary theme, with every control still a control. It has two
//     more, "minim-classic" and "minim-silver", which are panels rather than
//     dressings (face.go), and the skin key, Ctrl+K or a right-click
//     switches between all three live (skins.go).
//   - A skinned window need not be a rectangle. The silhouette is the skin's
//     (window.shape), so the app never mentions it, and the strip stands on
//     a stepped chin with the desktop showing through beside it.
//   - The proportions are design pixels rather than a frozen size. 275 by
//     116 is what this shape was at 1×; at 1.75 it is 481 by 203 and the art
//     is drawn from the 2× sheet at whole multiples, because the skin is
//     declared pixelated.
