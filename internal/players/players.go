// Package players is the model the three player demos share.
//
// The three apps are **visual** demos. Nothing here decodes, mixes or plays
// anything: there is no audio stack, no video stack and no media dependency
// of any kind in this toolkit, and adding one would make the demos a
// different project. What they demonstrate is skins, shaped windows and the
// chrome a media player of its era was made of — so the model underneath is
// a clock that counts, a list of invented tracks, a band of numbers that
// look like an analyser, and the arithmetic of windows that stick together.
//
// Everything in this package is plain data with no toolkit types in it, so
// the parts that are easy to get wrong — the transport's wrap at the end of
// a track, the seek bar's fraction, where a snapped window lands — are
// tested headless without opening a window at all.
//
// The three apps are in their own packages beside this one, because a
// player's whole point is its look and no two of these three share any of
// it:
//
//	internal/players/minim     the compact one, 275x116, a pixel skin
//	internal/players/marquee   the big one, with a compact mode
//	internal/players/lantern   the shaped one, with a themed switch
